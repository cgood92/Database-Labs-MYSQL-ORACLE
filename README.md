MYSQL and Oralce SQL Database Labs
=============

Michael McLaughlin was my instructor at BYU-Idaho.  He taught Database I and Database II classes.  During these classes, we were required to pass complicated weekly labs, involving lots of different database skills, joins, and queries.  Though these projects don't produce a specific service or product to display, it gives a good impression of the database skills that I acquired.  It should be noted that my scripts passed 100% of all the unit test cases produced by the instructor.
